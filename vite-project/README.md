REPORT
During the last project, our primary focus was testing our JavaScript skills, resulting in the old site having a bare minimum of design features. Upon researching user behavior, I found that people quickly left the site due to its limited features and unappealing colors and structure.

For the new site, I began developing some of the features I envisioned it should have. These include an issue page where users can create a ticket for an event, a login page to store credentials and fetch an auth token, and a send functionality allowing users to send tickets to one another. I spent considerable time coding an exchange feature, only to discover a server-side issue specific to my account. Customer service has been notified and plans to resolve the issue within a week after my delivery. The updated styling has received better user feedback, as they can now explore features and navigate through pages more seamlessly, thanks to improved navigation. One area for improvement is communicating the site's purpose and goal to users, as some did not fully understand this.

The site's purpose is to demonstrate a real-life use case for blockchain technology. A ticketing system serves as a good example, but the system is not limited to tickets alone. It can accommodate any form of digital certificate. The primary motivation for using such a system is data sovereignty and ownership. As the network validators (miners) monitor and secure transactions and issuance, there is no central authority controlling the legitimacy of the ticket state. In practical terms, this means that the ticket is controlled by whoever holds the private key to one's wallet, and users can transact tickets between them without involving the issuer. As long as the wallet provider can display a STAS token, the user can use the ticket without accessing this website.

This solution has its limitations; users must store private keys themselves to avoid losing access. Additionally, purchasing and selling are currently only possible through cryptocurrency or another STAS token. This is impractical for ordinary users who prefer to pay in NOK or other widely-used currencies and who are not willing to risk losing their password.
